Find Yourself a Prom Date!

By Emma Bernstein, Jennifer Lee, and Mary McGreal


A statement of the problem you are solving and or a high level description of the project.
A description as to how the project will be used (describe the user interface).
A description of your technical design. This should include:
How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.
How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.
What data structures you will be using and how.
What algorithms you will be using, and how.
A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project.
Remember -- this is a working document, it should be updated as your design changes.
